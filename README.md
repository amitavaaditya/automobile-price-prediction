# Predicting selling price of cars

The main motive here is to predict the selling price of cars based on the specifications and features. We have a dataset of past history of cars listed by specification and their corresponding prices.

Using that data, we built a model to best approximate the relationship between the features and response variables to generate predictions.

This is a classic regresion problem where the response is the **price** of the car and the features are its specifications.

### Languages and tools used:
This is completely done in python (v3.6), using jupyterlab for experimentation and the standard libraries used for ML. The complete list of packages are given in *requirements.txt*

### Instructions on how to use:
- Install Python 3 (3.4+ should do)
- Install the necessary packages using **pip install -r requirements.txt** (it is advisable to create a separate python virtual environment)
- Copy the dataset to the project directory (not present in this repo)
- Launch jupyterlab or jupyter notebook to inspect the notebook files (.ipynb)
- Run the final pipeline using the **model.py** script.
